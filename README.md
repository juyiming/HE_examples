Code and examples for paper: A Hierarchical Explanation Generation Method Based on Feature Interaction Detection

# Visualization 
Visualization examples for hierarchical explanations of HE_loo and HE_lime on SST-2 and MNLI datasets.

# Implementation
The implementation of HE_loo and HE_lime.

The implementations are based on the Huggingfaceâ€™s transformer model (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and the official code repository of LIME (https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).

Among them, the lime-text.py and lime_base in the LIME library have been rewritten. After installing LIME, they need to be replaced with rewritten files.

In visualization.py, the prediction labels of examples to be visualized need to be loaded as the variable: labels.
